# SigmaR19 - Cura 4.6.2
Made a working version where we can use Main version of Cura  instead of BCN3D software to slice and print. 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Note!!!!!!!!!!!!

Pls make sure you backup of all printers Definitions/Extruders/profile before trying this. - Im not responsible for loss of profiles / Corrupt /Damage profiles or other things. 
Please make sure you do backup of everything just in case if its causes any problem. 

Have Changed few settings on Main FDMPRINTERS.def file so as to apply few settings for SigmaR19 machine settings. 
Included Separated Sigma Mirror, Sigma Duplication and Sigma Dual Mode. - *Not Printed Tested with all settings*
Wil update to have as single machine to select different mode - Later. 

Problem - When dropping model to Mirror/Duplicate Machine, autoarrange is not working, pls move manually. -> will try to fix.

To fix : 
1.Fix for Cura 4.8 Slicing Bug.
2.Autoarrange for Mirror/Duplication Mode.
